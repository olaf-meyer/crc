= Configuring the virtual machine

Use the `cpus` and `memory` properties to configure the default number of vCPUs and amount of memory available to the {prod} virtual machine, respectively.

[IMPORTANT]
====
You cannot change the configuration of an existing {prod} virtual machine.
To enable configuration changes, you must delete the existing virtual machine and create a new one.

To create the new virtual machine, first delete the existing {prod} virtual machine, then start a new virtual machine with the configuration changes:

[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} delete
$ {bin} start
----
====

[WARNING]
====
The [command]`{bin} delete` command results in the loss of data stored in the {prod} virtual machine.
Save any desired information stored in the virtual machine before running this command.
====

.Procedure

* To increase the number of vCPUs available to the virtual machine:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} config set cpus _<number>_
----
+
The default value for the `cpus` property is `4`.
The number of vCPUs to assign must be greater than or equal to the default.

* To increase the memory available to the virtual machine:
+
[subs="+quotes,attributes"]
----
$ {bin} config set memory _<number-in-mib>_
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Values for available memory are set in mebibytes (MiB).
One gibibyte (GiB) of memory is equal to 1024 MiB.
====
+
The default value for the `memory` property is `8192`.
The amount of memory to assign must be greater than or equal to the default.
