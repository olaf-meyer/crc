= Accessing the OpenShift web console

.Prerequisites

* A running {prod} virtual machine.
For more information, see <<starting-the-virtual-machine_{context}>>.

.Procedure

To access the OpenShift web console, follow these steps:

. Run [command]`{bin} console`.
This will open your web browser and direct it to the web console.

. Log in to the OpenShift web console as the `developer` user with the password printed in the output of the [command]`{bin} start` command.

[NOTE]
====
* You can also view the password for the `developer` and `kubeadmin` users by running [command]`{bin} console --credentials`.
* You can initially access the cluster through either the `kubeadmin` or `developer` user.
Use the `developer` user for creating projects or OpenShift applications and for application deployment.
Only use the `kubeadmin` user for administrative tasks such as creating new users, setting roles, and so on.
====

See <<troubleshooting-codeready-containers_{context}>> if you cannot access the {prod} OpenShift cluster.
