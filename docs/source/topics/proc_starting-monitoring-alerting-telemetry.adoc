= Starting Monitoring, Alerting, and Telemetry

To make sure {prod} can run on a typical laptop, some resource-heavy services get disabled by default.
One of these is Prometheus and the related monitoring, alerting, and telemetry functionality.
Telemetry functionality is responsible for listing your cluster in the link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift[Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager].

.Prerequisites

* A running {prod} virtual machine and a working [command]`oc` command.
For more information, see <<accessing-the-openshift-cluster-with-oc_{context}>>.
* You must log in through [command]`oc` as the `kubeadmin` user.
* You must assign additional memory to the {prod} virtual machine.
At least 12 GiB of memory (a value of `12288`) is recommended.
For more information, see <<configuring-the-virtual-machine_{context}>>.

.Procedure

. List unmanaged Operators and note the numeric index for `cluster-monitoring-operator`:

** On Linux or {mac}:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc get clusterversion version -ojsonpath='{range .spec.overrides[*]}{.name}{"\n"}{end}' | nl -v 0
----

// TODO: Revise the command for PowerShell in the future.
** On {msw} using PowerShell:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
PS> oc get clusterversion version -ojsonpath='{range .spec.overrides[*]}{.name}{"\n"}{end}' | % {$nl++;"`t$($nl-1) `t $_"};$nl=0
----

. Start monitoring, alerting, and telemetry services using the identified numeric index:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
----
$ oc patch clusterversion/version --type='json' -p '[{"op":"remove", "path":"/spec/overrides/_<unmanaged-operator-index>_"}]' -oyaml
----
