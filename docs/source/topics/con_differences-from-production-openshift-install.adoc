= Differences from a production OpenShift installation

{rh-prod} is a regular OpenShift installation with the following notable differences:

* **The {prod} OpenShift cluster is ephemeral and is not intended for production use.**
* It uses a single node which behaves as both a master and worker node.
* It disables the `machine-config` and `monitoring` Operators by default.
** These disabled Operators cause the corresponding parts of the web console to be non-functional.
** For the same reason, there is no upgrade path to newer OpenShift versions.
* The OpenShift instance runs in a virtual machine.
This may cause other differences, particularly with external networking.
